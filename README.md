## Quick startups (2 ways)
- Run with **start.bat**
  - this process will install all necessary packages for backend and frontend services
  - you may be prompted to give permissions for npm install/update - keep checking startup terminals
  - after packages are installed and services start -- the application will open in your browser
- Manual startup
  - install all necessary packages
    ```
    # navigate to source folder (tvz-mean-chat-application)
    npm install
    cd ./angular-src
    npm install
    ```
  - open terminal for backend and start service
    ```
    start cmd
    # navigate to backend source folder (tvz-mean-chat-application)
    npm start
    ```
  - open terminal for frontend and start service
    ```
    start cmd
    # navigate to frontend source folder (tvz-mean-chat-application/angular-src)
    npm start
    ```
