## Quick startups (2 ways)
- Run with **start.bat**
  - this process will install all necessary packages for backend and frontend services
  - you may be prompted to give permissions for npm install/update - keep checking startup terminals
  - after packages are installed and services start -- the application will open in your browser
- Manual startup
  ```
  # navigate to source folder (tvz-mean-chat-application)
  npm install
  cd ./angular-src
  npm install
  ```
  open terminal for backend and start service
  ```
  start cmd
  npm start
  ```
  open terminal for frontend and start service
  ```
  start cmd
  npm start
  ```
